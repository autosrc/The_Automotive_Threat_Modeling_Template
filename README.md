# Background 20
A threat modeling workshop for automotive-related technologies requires DFDs with custom elements, tailored threats and specific recommendations. 
The lack of a specific template for automotive threat modeling brought about the development of the Automotive Threat Modeling Template, which takes advantage of a new feature in the MS Threat Modeling Tool 2016 that allows the creation of entirely new customised templates.

The Automotive Threat Modeling (TM) Template was created using the Microsoft (MS) Threat Modeling Tool 2016 and therefore threat models are created using this product.

# The Solution and its Features
The Automotive Threat Modeling Template permits the creation of specific automotive threat models with:
* Processes and Data Stores related to the components of connected cars.
* External Interactors tailored to an automotive system.
* Data Flows that correspond to the messages exchanged over the air or inside the vehicle itself.
* Trust Boundaries that take into consideration the environment and the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) networks.
* Threat Types and Categories that follow the STRIDE classification, based on known and potential threats to the connected carsâ€™ components.
* Tailored Threat Properties including:
 * Priority, based on the risk of every threat applied in its context.
 * Attack Methods to potentially exploit the identified threats and to help further with the creation of Attack Trees.
 * Recommendations that suggest how to mitigate the threats.

# Installation
Run the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool 2016.
Before creating a new model, select the latest version of the Automotive Threat Modeling Template under "Template For New Models".
